          'Pat the pork dry with paper towels; place in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt, pepper, and enough of the Spanish spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Turn to coat. Transfer to the center of a sheet pan. Roast 10 minutes. Leaving the oven on, remove from the oven. Meanwhile, in a separate, large bowl, combine the potato wedges, onion wedges, and halved brussels sprouts; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and the weeknight hero spice blend. Toss to coat. Reserving the bowl, carefully transfer to the sheet pan and arrange in an even layer around the edges. Return to the oven and roast 15 to 19 minutes for medium (the center may still be slightly pink), or until the pork is cooked to your desired degree of doneness* and the vegetables are tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven. Carefully transfer the roasted pork to a cutting board. Let rest at least 5 minutes.',
